# SIS-SJC
Student Information System
This is a website under development and on its initial stage.
I have used CSS & HTML for the front end of the webpage and small part of js.
The home page has been done with a navigation bar and direction to the Login page.
I have planned to use PHP for my server side scripting and have used it to build my Login page.
